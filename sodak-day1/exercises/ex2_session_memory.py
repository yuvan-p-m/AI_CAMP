"""EXERCISE 2 - Session memory.                   (about 20 minutes)

Complete the chat() helper so a conversation remembers itself, and prove that
a different thread does not.

CHECKPOINT
  [ ] Turn 2 on the same thread resolves "her" correctly
  [ ] A different thread_id has no carryover
  [ ] After 25 turns, trim() has not orphaned a tool message (no API error)
