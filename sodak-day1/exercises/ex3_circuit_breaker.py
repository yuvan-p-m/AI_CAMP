"""EXERCISE 3 - Break the circuit breaker.        (about 15 minutes)

Write a tool that ALWAYS fails. Confirm the agent receives the error three
times, then receives ToolDisabled, then reports the problem honestly instead
of looping until the iteration cap.

CHECKPOINT
  [ ] Exactly 3 failures in the trace, then the disabled message
  [ ] outcome is "completed", NOT "max_iterations"
  [ ] The final answer tells the user something is broken
