"""EXERCISE 1 - A tool with a side effect.        (about 20 minutes)

Write send_notice(roll_number, subject, body) that records a notice and
returns a confirmation.

The hard part is not the code. It is the DOCSTRING. Write it so the model
knows WHEN to call it - not merely what it does.

CHECKPOINT
  [ ] Fires on:     "Inform Priya about her fee balance"
  [ ] Does NOT fire on: "What is Priya's fee balance?"
  [ ] Appears in the trace with its arguments
